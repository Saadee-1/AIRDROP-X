PyInstaller quick-start notes for AIRDROP-X Qt app
===================================================

This is NOT an executable spec file, but a guide for building one-click
Windows binaries for the Qt desktop application defined in `qt_app.py`.

Suggested basic command
-----------------------

Run from the project root:

    pyinstaller --noconfirm --clean ^
        --name AIRDROP-X ^
        --windowed ^
        qt_app.py

Key notes
---------

- Entry point: `qt_app.py` (creates QApplication and AirdropMainWindow).
- Required Python packages at build time:
  - PyQt6
  - matplotlib
  - numpy
- The engine, Monte Carlo, and decision logic are imported as normal
  Python modules; no special hooks are required for them.
- If matplotlib backends cause warnings, ensure `matplotlib.backends`
  is collected by PyInstaller (recent versions handle this automatically).

After running the command, the standalone EXE will be placed under
`dist/AIRDROP-X/` on Windows.
